    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250 ml (250g) espresso coffee 1 cup</li>
        <li>40 ml (40g) Kahlua optional </li>
        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup (165g) caster sugar</li>
        <li>750 grams mascarpone 3 cups</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste</li>
        <li>30 Savoiardi ladyfinger sponges</li>
        <li>cocoa powder for dusting</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the espresso coffee and add to a medium bowl. Add the Kahlua (if using). Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Over your stove, set up a small saucepan of gently simmering water. Add the egg yolks and sugar to a large, heat-proof bowl that will fit snugly over the saucepan without allowing steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Place the bowl carefully over the saucepan, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the boiling water. Using electric beaters (or a whisk), continually beat the yolks and sugar over the heat until they become pale, fluffy and roughly double in volume. Allow to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Using electric beaters on low speed, add the mascarpone and vanilla bean paste to the egg yolk mixture and beat until stiff.</li>
        <li>Place the coffee, Savoiardi ladyfinger sponges and a 18 X 29 cm tray on a bench, ready to assemble.</li>
        <li>Working quickly, dip each side of the sponge fingers into the coffee and Kahlua mixture. * Only dip for 1 second each side, as too long will cause them to become too soggy.</li>
        <li>Allow any excess coffee to drip from the sponges and assemble them in a single layer in the bottom of the dish. If there are any gaps, cut some sponge fingers to fit.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the mascarpone mixture evenly over the top of the sponge layer.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process with a final layer of coffee soaked sponges. For the final layer, either spread or pipe the remaining mascarpone over the top</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (or overnight is best).</li>
        <li>Top with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or some dark chocolate shavings, if you prefer.</li>
    </ol>
